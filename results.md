In this page, there are results of our method with data from two different sites, both T1w: on Glasgow data and on AHEAD data [link](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117200).

## Glasgow




## AHEAD: `fine tuning`

In this experiment, we accomplished very good results making `fine tuning` for AHEAD data. We selected only 20 volumes to perform fine tuning using our model trained on Glasgow data. Comparisons are made against FreeSurfer v7.
