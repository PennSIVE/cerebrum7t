For every volume of the testing set, two segmentations are presented: FreeSurfer v7 and CEREBRUM7T.
The original volumes can be downloaded from [the original repository](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811920306868?via%3Dihub).
Please notice that we cropped the anatomical volumes to the dimension `Dim_cereb = (256, 352, 224)`, using [this script](https://github.com/rockNroll87q/cerebrum7t/blob/master/data/AHEAD_volumes_cropping.py).
