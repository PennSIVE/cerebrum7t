In our work, we tackle the problem of automatic 7T MRI segmentation. 
The generated model is able to produce accurate multi-structure segmentation masks on six different classes, in only few seconds.
Classes are: gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), ventricles, cerebellum, brainstem, and basal ganglia.
